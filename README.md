## Mouse Functions


</div>

### Description

I know there are other posts on PSC that do similar, but I wanted to put some of the mouse functions I found useful into a class module. You can show or hide the cursor, swap mouse buttons, perform left clicks or right clicks on different handles (Good to possibly use with sendkeys were you need to click a button). Also has a mouse trap option that takes any handle (not just a form). Let me know what other functions you think i should include I know I could have put in LMouseDown and LMouseUp, but I never really had to use them. But if you want me to put them in, I will and then I'll upload this page. Vote if you think the code is useful.
